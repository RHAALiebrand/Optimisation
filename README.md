# Optimisation

This folder contains some samples of optimisation codes I've written. The one I think is most interesting is the skipole optimisation which was a project done for a Norwegian entrepreneur who was designing a new pole. This piece of code combines several different aspect and uses the external program XFlow to perform live aerodynamic calculations while the MATLAB script is running. 

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
